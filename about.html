<p>So, hi, welcome! If you’re here, there are probably a few reasons for this. Maybe you know me from Discord or elsewhere and stumbled across this page. Maybe you’re here for the (still directionless) blog that may or may not eventually just become a semi-regular mathematics problem database.</p>

<p>More likely, you’re here for the CCDL.</p>

<p>The CCDL, or Celeste Classic Deathless List, ranks some of the most challenging Deathless maps and mods of Celeste Classic. The reason I made this website was to create something similar to Pointercrate, but for Celeste Classic maps.</p>

<p>Regardless of why you’re here, I hope you enjoy your stay!</p>
