<h1>The Nyl Site (Under Construction!)</h1>
<p>I plan to use this website (which is made using Jekyll and is being hosted using Github Pages, by the way) to store a number of my public projects. I have plans to make an "open source trading card game," for instance, so stay tuned for that! I also use this site to host the Celeste Classic Deathless List, just click "CCDL" in the navigation bar in order to check it out!

For now, if you'd like to play any of my Celeste Classic mods, they'll all be hosted here:
<hr>
<a href="{% link /UnnerfedS/s.html %}">Unnerfed S</a>

<a href="{% link /Squiggle/squiggle.html %}">Squiggle</a>
<hr>
<a href="{% link /Unknown/unknown.html %}">UNKNOWN (No custom music yet!)</a>
</p>
